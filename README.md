Track forward and backward motion using accelerometer in android app.
You can find a .apk file named app-debug in the above list of files.
You just have to download and install in your phone.
Try to keep the phone parallel to your body and then move the phone forward or backward,and it will show you moving forward or backward.
The results might be fluctuating because of accelerometer sensor's values. For better accuracy, we can use GPS.
